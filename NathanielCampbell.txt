Hi, my name is Nathaniel Campbell.
I go by Nate and this is my third year at WCC. I am aiming for a degree in Computer Science:
Java. I was interested in programming because of the creativity and possibilities technology
 has to offer in today's society. Finishing this class will yield my degree and will 
enable me to search for a job in what I want to do. I enjoy writing and reading. I usually 
am not much of a talker unless I'm comfortable in my environment. I do enjoy getting to know
people and also making new friends. I aim to at least be reknowned and respected by my peers.
 A few of my favorite things are Kingdom Hearts, music, and learning new things. I want to become an 
excellent programmer and succeed in life. I want to aim to have a nice house, and at least 2
cars, one being a lamborghini and the other I'm unsure. I look forward to cooperating and 
hopefully enjoying this class because I'm extremely nervous about this class. I've
never worked on a programming project with others before but I'm open to the idea.
I hope to have a great semester!
