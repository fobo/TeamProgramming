My name is William Matteson.  I have some amature experience with programming, and I'm fast at looking up how to do things.
I'm very willing to be wrong about things so I'll always do my best to not be stubborn unless I genuinely believe what I'm arguing about is correct.
If I know how something works, I'm decent at explaining it so feel free to ask me a question.  If I don't know how it works, I'll figure it out with you.
